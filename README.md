*This is a quick tutorial to get you start with django-crispy-forms and never look back. Crispy-forms is a great application that gives you control over how you render Django forms, without breaking the default behavior. This tutorial is going to be tailored towards Bootstrap 4, but it can also be used with older Bootstrap versions as well as with the Foundation framework.*
